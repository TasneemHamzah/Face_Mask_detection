# Face_Mask_detection_CNN_Keras

This project is implemented in Python using Keras, Tensorflow and OpenCV.

This my convolutional neural network model that has been trained in order to detect the face mask, the model got 98.5% accuracy on the test dataset. 

In order to reproduce this work:

1- download the dataset from 

https://github.com/prajnasb/observations/tree/master/experiements/data

athen run the preprocissing file.

2- download the model weihghts.Then run the training file.

3- the model deployment open the webcam and classify whither the person is wearing a mask or not, it's preffered to use high quallity cam, to achieve the best results.
